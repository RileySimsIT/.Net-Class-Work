    <p> Welcome to the Main Page for my 2016 - 2017 eCommerce Site. This site was made in the course INFO3091 aka ASP.NET Programming. The color scheme I have gone with
        for my website is Red, White, and Black. I chose the theme of a Fanshawe merchandise store and thus my included products are all Fanshawe merchandise. Click any of the
        buttons above to reach a different page. On the Customers page you can add, edit, find, and delete Customers. On the Products page you can add, edit, find, and delete Products.
        On the Weather page you'll find the local london Weather. On the Catalog page you can find all the products available to you and add them to your cart for purchase. On the cart page you
        can review and finalize your order and goto the Checkout page. On the Checkoutpage you can complete your transaction either as a customer or anonymously. The promo
        page allows you to see all the special promotions going on in the store
